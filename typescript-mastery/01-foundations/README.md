# 01. TypeScript Foundations

## Core Concepts

### Basic Types
TypeScript extends JavaScript with static type checking. Every value has a type.

### Type vs Interface
- **Type**: More flexible, can represent primitives, unions, intersections
- **Interface**: Better for object shapes, supports declaration merging

### When to Use What?
- **Use Interface**: When defining object shapes, especially for public APIs
- **Use Type**: For unions, intersections, computed types, and aliases

## Key Learning Points

1. **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
2. **IntelliSense**: Better IDE support and autocomplete
3. **Refactoring**: Safe code changes across large codebases
4. **Documentation**: Types serve as living documentation

## Examples Overview

- `basic-types.ts` - Primitive types and basic usage
- `type-vs-interface.ts` - Comparison and use cases  
- `functions.ts` - Function typing patterns
- `type-assertions.ts` - Type guards and assertions
- `exercises.ts` - Practice problems
- `solutions.ts` - Exercise solutions

## Next Steps

After mastering foundations:
1. Understand when each feature is appropriate
2. Practice with real code examples
3. Move to advanced types module
4. Apply concepts in small projects
