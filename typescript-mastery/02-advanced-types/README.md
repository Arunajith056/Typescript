# 02. Advanced Types

## Overview

Advanced TypeScript types enable powerful type-level programming and complex data modeling. These features help you create robust, type-safe applications that catch errors at compile time.

## Key Concepts

### Union Types
Combine multiple types with `|` operator for flexibility.

### Intersection Types  
Merge types with `&` operator for composition.

### Literal Types
Use specific values as types for precision.

### Conditional Types
Create type-level logic with `extends` keyword.

### Mapped Types
Transform existing types systematically.

### Template Literal Types
Generate types from string patterns.

## Real-World Applications

- **API Response Handling**: Model different response states
- **Form Validation**: Create type-safe form schemas  
- **State Management**: Model complex application states
- **Configuration**: Type-safe configuration objects
- **Event Systems**: Type-safe event handling

## Module Contents

- `union-intersection.ts` - Union and intersection type patterns
- `conditional-types.ts` - Type-level programming with conditions
- `mapped-types.ts` - Transforming types with mapped types
- `template-literals.ts` - String manipulation at type level
- `utility-patterns.ts` - Common utility type patterns
- `exercises.ts` - Practice problems
- `solutions.ts` - Complete solutions

## Learning Path

1. Start with union and intersection types
2. Master conditional types for logic
3. Learn mapped types for transformations
4. Explore template literals for string types
5. Apply patterns in real projects

## Next Steps

After mastering advanced types, move to generics module to combine these concepts with generic programming patterns.
