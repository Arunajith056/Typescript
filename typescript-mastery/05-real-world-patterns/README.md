# 05. Real-World Patterns

## Overview

This module demonstrates how to apply TypeScript concepts in real-world scenarios. Learn industry-standard patterns, best practices, and common solutions used in production applications.

## Key Patterns

### API Development
- Request/Response type modeling
- Error handling strategies
- Validation and serialization
- Authentication and authorization

### State Management
- Redux-style reducers with types
- Zustand store patterns
- React Context patterns
- Immutable update patterns

### Form Handling
- Type-safe form schemas
- Validation strategies
- Field-level type safety
- Dynamic form generation

### Component Architecture
- Props interface design
- Render props patterns
- Higher-order component typing
- Compound components

### Data Processing
- Transformation pipelines
- Functional programming patterns
- Stream processing
- ETL operations

## Module Contents

- `api-patterns.ts` - REST API and GraphQL patterns
- `state-management.ts` - Various state management approaches
- `form-validation.ts` - Comprehensive form handling
- `component-patterns.ts` - React component patterns
- `data-processing.ts` - Data transformation patterns
- `error-handling.ts` - Error management strategies
- `testing-patterns.ts` - Type-safe testing approaches
- `exercises.ts` - Real-world exercises
- `solutions.ts` - Complete implementations

## Learning Objectives

- Apply TypeScript in complex scenarios
- Design maintainable type architectures
- Handle real-world edge cases
- Optimize for developer experience
- Build production-ready code

## Best Practices

1. Design types from the API/domain perspective
2. Use discriminated unions for state modeling
3. Prefer composition over inheritance
4. Apply the principle of least privilege for types
5. Document complex type relationships
6. Test type constraints with unit tests

## Industry Insights

Learn patterns used by companies like:
- Netflix (form validation)
- Stripe (API client design)
- Discord (state management)
- Vercel (component architecture)
- GitHub (error handling)

## Next Steps

After mastering these patterns, apply them in the projects module to build complete applications that demonstrate professional TypeScript usage.
